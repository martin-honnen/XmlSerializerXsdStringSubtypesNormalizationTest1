# XmlSerializerXsdStringSubtypesNormalizationTest1

Sample .NET 8 console app that shows that .NET knows how to normalize XSD xs:string subtypes like xs:token, xs:language, xs:Name.
Created to contrast the results of this application with the (not normalized) results I get with XPathNavigator.TypedValue for those types in another sample project.
